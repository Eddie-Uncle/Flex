## Contributing

Always open an issue before sending a PR. Talk about the problem/feature that you want to fix. If it's really a good thing you can submit your PR. If you send an PR without talking about before what it is, you may work for nothing.

As always, if you want something that only make sense to you, just fork Flex and start a new theme.

## Live example

I'm using Flex in my [personal blog](http://janikarhunen.fi/).
